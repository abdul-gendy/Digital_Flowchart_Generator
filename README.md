# Digital_Flowchart_Generator
The aim of this project is to allow the user to quickly draw a flowchart template made up of shapes and arrows in their required order on a piece of paper and then
convert an image of that into a digital template that the user can then start working on right away. This application could be useful in many settings, especially in brainstorming sessions where individuals donâ€™t want to spend a lot of time creating a flowchart template on a software tool.
